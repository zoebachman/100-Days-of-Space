# DAY 1 - 

What better time to do a 100 Days project than during the middle of a quarantine. 
Given that I have nowhere to go, why not use this time to some purpose? Even if it's just making silly online sketches. 

I've previously played around with making sketches of space in p5.js, mostly focusing on animated constellations. For this first sketch, I was thinking of what it looks like to see the entire universe peak out behind earth. 

I randomized the location and size of the stars, so it appears like the earth is rotating. I slowed down the frame rate to make it look as if it was appearing more slowly (though it's fun to see it spin really fast, too). 

I started with the earth just being a big blue circle, but I thought it would be more fun to have an actual image. Of course, maybe it's more 100 days like to do one and then the other but eh, it's my frist time and it's the first day. 

Happy start of 100 days!
