# DAY 5 - 

Ok so, baby steps. Keeping it simple and building from there. I just created another palette that has "night time" colors and added a little if statement that changes between the two palettes depending on the location of the cursor on the y axis. Yes. Still not feeling 100% but hey! I did something today. 

Perhaps tomorrow I'll use lerping to smooth out the transition and get some cool in between colors.
