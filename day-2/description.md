# DAY 1 - 

So, now that I'm on my second day, I'm reaallly starting to wish that I had done a simpler version yesterday. I mean, I guess I could just redo my one for yesterday and then make the other one today and this one tomorrow but like, honestly, doesn't matter. 

I was having a similar set of questions today. So, I started with (what I thought) was the simple idea of bringing in the entire earth image and rotating it on it's axis. That's it, one change. But apparently I didn't know how to do that (and the rotate [p5 documentation](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/rotate) and [examples](https://p5js.org/examples/transform-rotate.html) weren't giving me what I wanted), so I went down lots of rabbit holes. Many fun and frankly, pretty beautiful and way more intriguing rabbit holes. I mean, I think I already decided what I want to do for tomorrow. But there were also several other things that (I think) could be their own separate day. 

Maybe it's because it's early and I'm still full of inspiration, but for some reason the idea of commiting one of these ideations/variations as *it's own day* seems like....*wasteful* or something. 

On the other hand, isn't it interesting to see how an idea can change and evolve over time? 

Given this is my first 100 days, I guess it makes me question my objectives. Is it to show an evolution? Is it to show learning? Is it to show a variety of ideas? 

And even though I'm only two days in, I find myself trying to answer all these questions, like I should have a perfectly curated and branded set of 100 objects and that if I **don't** think this through beforehand, it will look like a jumbled mess. 

I should probably cut myself some more slack and think less about output and more about process.
