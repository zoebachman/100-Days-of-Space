# DAY 4 - 

So coming back after a couple of day hiatus. Knew it was going to happen, but didn't think it would happen to early. Anyways...

For today's sketch I'm moving on to a different subject. Starting to think about what life looks like on other planets. A whole other genre of landscape art. I'm starting simple, using primitives to construct a basic mars-like landscape, with some mountains and a setting sun. Digging the geometric vibes, feels kinda 70s southwestern aesthetic. 

I think I'll do what I did last time, which is iterate on this idea a couple of times. My original vision was to have a gradient sky, but I'm digging the color lerping technique. First time using it in p5, so happy I used this simple sketch as an opportunity to learn something new. 

For next steps...I'd like to try programatically altering the colors, like a shift from day to night. Also try that gradient thing. Maybe then add in a user interaction? Let's make it another three day thang.
