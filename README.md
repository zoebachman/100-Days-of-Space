# 100-Days-of-Space

## SPACE, THE FINAL FRONTIER

For my 100 days project, I've chosen to make pictures of outer space. I've always loved images from space. When I was a kid I thought I wanted to be an astronomer, but I quickly realized in my first college astronomy class that what I was really interested in was beautiful pictures, not physics. 

Anyways. Now that I'm stuck inside for the forseeable future, there is something poeticish about immersing myself in images of outer space. Also can't be a coincidence that I started re-watching _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ on the first day of mandatory WFH or started reading N.K. Jemisin's _The Fifth Season_. Fantasy and adventure is transportive. And what could be further away from my apartment than outer space?
