# DAY 1 - 

Third day. I'm tired. Maybe it's the end of the week, maybe it's something else, but in any case I'm glad I already knew what I wanted to do so I could just do it. 

Day 3 was one of the things that I made while *trying* to make day 2. But it was so funnn that I didn't want it to just not be seen. So anyways, here's day 3 with some chaotic energy. 

We've got the world rotating, but now it's rotating from the (unseen) corner of the image, rather than it's center. The stars are still animating (as is the rotating world), but now the background is drawn only once so we're seeing the trail of the earth and the accumulation of stars. I always loved the leftover effects of drawing over and over the background. I took the stroke off the ellipses so that it just becomes a whiteout. 

I played around again with the framerate and decided to bump it up by another 10 frames again. I've never really played with frame rate before these sketches, so it's been fun to do so.
